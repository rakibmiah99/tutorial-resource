**Single Line Comment** 
```python
#This is a comment 
print("Hello World");
```

**Multiline Comment**
Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.
you could insert a `#` for each line:
```python
#This is a comment  
#written in  
#more than just one line  
print("Hello, World!")
```

**OR you can use a multiline string.**
This is not good practice. with out assign or with out use python ignore it 
```python 
"""  
This is a comment  
written in  
more than just one line  
"""  
print("Hello, World!")
```
